# 🛡️ Shield: Deep Scan

**A Chrome extension that detects job scams using heuristic NLP and domain analysis — before you apply.**

## 📌 What It Does

Job scam postings are increasingly sophisticated. Shield: Deep Scan analyzes job listings in real time directly in your browser, flagging suspicious patterns such as:

- Vague or exaggerated salary promises
- Requests for personal/financial information upfront
- Unverified or newly registered employer domains
- Common scam language patterns detected via heuristic NLP
